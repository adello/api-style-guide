# Adello API Style Guide

## Purpose

Great RESTful APIs look like they were designed by a single team. This promotes API adoption, reduces friction, and enables clients to use them properly. To build APIs that meet this standard, and to answer many common questions encountered along the way of RESTful API development, the we created these guidelines for ourselves. We are sharing it with you to inspire additional discussion and refinement within and among your teams, and contribute our learnings and suggestions to the tech community at large.
